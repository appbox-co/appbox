# A New Era Begins at Appbox

After months of working behind the scenes, pulling late nights, and drinking way too much coffee, I'm excited to finally show you what we've been building. This isn't just another update. It's us rebuilding Appbox from the ground up.

## Welcome to Our New Digital Home

You're looking at our brand new website! We've finally said goodbye to our old WordPress setup. The whole thing has been rebuilt with modern tech that's faster, more secure, and actually scales properly.

This new site is going to become home to proper documentation, regular blog posts (like this one), and eventually the frontend for our new platform. The design isn't just cleaner - it's actually functional and makes finding stuff way easier.

We're using Next.js with ContentLayer under the hood, which gives us really fast performance and a much better development experience. The site supports multiple languages, handles SEO automatically, has RSS feeds in both XML and JSON, and includes dark mode because nobody should have to deal with bright white screens at 2am.

## We're Going Open Source!

The website you're reading this on? The code is public and anyone can contribute to it.

This is huge for us. We've always tried to be transparent, but this is us putting our money where our mouth is and actually building with the community instead of just for them. If you're a developer and you've ever wanted to help shape the tools you use, now you can. Check out our GitHub repo for contribution guidelines and everything you need to get started.

## Introducing Appbox v2

The new website is just the beginning. We're working on Appbox v2, which is the biggest update we've ever done.

Container deployment has always been our thing, but v2 takes it further with what everyone's been asking for: full VPS support. The VPS apps will give you complete root access with no restrictions. If you need total control over your environment, this is what you've been waiting for.

This combines our proven container infrastructure with true VPS flexibility. It's not just a technical upgrade - it's rethinking what app hosting should be.

## Building Our Own Network Infrastructure

Here's the really big news, we're building our own network.

Not just adding more servers or upgrading bandwidth. We're registering our own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and buying dedicated equipment to build a network that's entirely ours.

What does this mean for you? We can control everything, optimize it specifically for Appbox users, and deliver reliability and performance that wasn't possible before.

## Immediate Peering with AMS-IX

To go with our network development, we're peering with AMS-IX for 100G of connectivity. This gives us direct access to one of the world's biggest internet exchanges, which means lower latency and better speeds for everyone.

This kind of connectivity is usually only available to much larger companies, but we want to provide enterprise-grade performance no matter what plan you're on.

## Price Adjustments

Building this infrastructure costs money, and while we're covering most of it, we do need to adjust our pricing for both new and existing customers.

I want to be upfront about this. The new pricing is already live on the site, and we'll be contacting existing customers soon with details about how this affects them.

This wasn't easy to decide, but it's necessary to fund the improvements that will make everything better for everyone.

The good news is that the increases are reasonable, and we're still very competitive. For example, our popular NG-4500 plan is only going up by â‚¬2.08 per month, which is still way less than comparable plans from competitors.

For existing customers, you'll only pay the difference between old and new pricing. If you have any promotional discounts, those stay on top of the new base price. We appreciate your loyalty.

Our discount structure stays the same:
- 5% off for quarterly payments
- 10% off for 6-month payments
- 15% off for annual payments

If you have automatic payments set up, the adjustment will happen with your next billing cycle after you receive the email. You don't need to do anything.

## More Storage!

It's not all about paying more though. We're also bumping storage on our lowest plan from 3TB to 3.5TB. That's a 16% increase, which makes our entry-level NG plan an even better deal despite the price change.

## What's Next?

This is just the start of what's coming for Appbox. Over the next few weeks and months, you'll see regular updates as we roll out new features, improve existing ones, and keep building the infrastructure for the next generation of app hosting.

We're planning to start testing our new network infrastructure in August/September, and we'll keep you updated as we make progress.

Our roadmap includes:
- VPS apps which will have no restrictions (like docker)
- Better documentation that actually covers everything
- A community showcase for cool things people are building with Appbox
- Regular technical blog posts about our infrastructure
- New containerized apps for specific use cases
- Better monitoring and analytics tools
- Enhanced security features across all plans

Thanks for sticking with us. Without our community, none of this would be possible.

More updates coming soon.
