# A New Era Begins at Appbox

After months of behind-the-scenes work, late nights, and countless cups of coffee, I'm absolutely thrilled to pull back the curtain on what we've been cooking up. This isn't just another update â€” it's a fundamental transformation of Appbox from the ground up.

## Welcome to Our New Digital Home

First things first â€” yes, what you're looking at is our brand new website! Gone are the days of our trusty but aging WordPress installation. We've completely rebuilt our online presence using a modern tech stack that prioritizes speed, security, and scalability.

This new site will eventually house extensive documentation, regular blog posts (like this one!), and serve as the foundation for our new platform frontend. The clean, intuitive design isn't just pretty â€” it's purposeful, making it easier than ever to find exactly what you need.

Behind the scenes, we're leveraging the latest web technologies to deliver a lightning-fast experience. Our development team has meticulously crafted every element of this site to ensure it not only looks great but performs exceptionally well too. We've built this using Next.js with ContentLayer for blazing fast performance, full internationalization support, and a fantastic developer experience.

Some of the technical highlights include:
- Full internationalization support for multiple languages
- Automatic SEO optimization for better discoverability
- Integrated RSS feeds in both XML and JSON formats
- Comprehensive content management for blogs and documentation
- Dark mode support for comfortable browsing day or night
- Lightning-fast page loads with optimized assets

## We're Going Open Source!

Perhaps the most significant shift in our company philosophy is our decision to go open source. That's right â€” the website you're browsing right now has its code available for anyone to see, modify, and improve upon.

This is a massive deal for us. We've always believed in transparency, but taking this step represents our deepest commitment yet to building with our community rather than just for it. We're actively encouraging contributions from developers, whether they're long-time Appbox users or just passionate about what we're building.

By opening our code to the world, we're inviting fresh perspectives, innovative solutions, and collaborative problem-solving. If you've ever wanted to shape the tools you use daily, now's your chance. Check out our GitHub repository, where you'll find comprehensive contribution guidelines and all the information you need to get started.

## Introducing Appbox v2

The new website is just the beginning. We're hard at work on Appbox v2, which represents the most significant evolution of our platform since we first launched.

While containerized app deployment has long been a cornerstone of our offering, Appbox v2 takes things to an entirely new level with our most requested feature ever: full VPS support. We're especially excited to announce that Appbox v2 will introduce VPS apps that provide a complete root experience. For users who need absolute control over their environment without any restrictions, this is the solution you've been waiting for.

This isn't just a technical upgrade â€” it's a reimagining of what app hosting can be, combining our battle-tested container infrastructure with true VPS flexibility.

## Building Our Own Network Infrastructure

Here comes the truly massive announcement: we're building our own network.

This isn't just about adding more servers or upgrading our pipes. We're talking about fundamental infrastructure â€” we're in the process of registering our own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and purchasing dedicated equipment to build a network that's truly ours from the ground up.

What does this mean for you? Control, reliability, and performance that simply wasn't possible before. When we own the infrastructure, we can optimize every aspect of it specifically for the unique demands of Appbox users.

## Immediate Peering with AMS-IX

To complement our network development, we're immediately peering with AMS-IX to add a staggering 100G of connectivity. This strategic partnership gives us direct access to one of the world's largest internet exchanges, dramatically reducing latency and improving speeds for all Appbox users.

This kind of connectivity is typically reserved for much larger companies, but we're committed to providing enterprise-grade performance regardless of your plan level.

## The Unavoidable: Price Adjustments

Building infrastructure of this caliber requires significant investment, and whilst we're shouldering the vast majority, unfortunately, this means we need to adjust our pricing structure for both new and existing customers.

I want to be completely transparent about this. The pricing has already been updated on this site, and we'll be reaching out to existing customers shortly with details about how these changes will affect them.

This wasn't an easy decision, but it's necessary to fund the improvements that will ultimately deliver a dramatically better experience for everyone.

Here's the good news: the increases are modest, and our pricing remains extremely competitive within the industry. For example, our popular NG-4500 plan is only increasing by â‚¬1.64 per month â€” still significantly less than comparable offerings from our competitors.

For our existing customers, we'll only be applying the difference between the old and new pricing. And even better â€” if you currently enjoy any promotional discounts, those will be maintained on top of the new base price. Your loyalty matters to us.

Our standard discount structure remains unchanged:
- 5% off for quarterly payments
- 10% off for 6-month payments
- 15% off for annual payments

If you have automatic payments set up, the price adjustment will happen seamlessly with your next billing cycle. No action is required on your part.

## The Silver Lining: More Storage!

It's not all about paying more, though. We're also increasing the storage on our lowest plan from 3TB to 3.5TB. This 16% boost gives our entry-level users significantly more room to work with, making our starter plan an even better value proposition despite the price adjustment.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning of a new chapter for Appbox. In the coming weeks and months, you'll see regular updates as we roll out new features, refine existing ones, and continue building the infrastructure that will power the next generation of app hosting.

We've set up a comprehensive roadmap that includes:
- Expanded documentation covering every aspect of our platform
- A community showcase highlighting innovative uses of Appbox
- Regular technical blog posts diving deep into our infrastructure
- New containerized apps tailored to specific use cases
- Improved monitoring and analytics tools
- Enhanced security features across all plans

We're incredibly grateful for your continued support and trust. Without our amazing community, none of this would be possible.

Stay tuned â€” the best is yet to come.
