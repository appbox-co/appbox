# We Did It - Our Network is Live!

Remember back in April when we announced we were building our own network infrastructure? Well, I'm thrilled to tell you that as of yesterday, it's finally live.

This has been months in the making, and honestly, seeing it all come together has been one of the most satisfying moments since we started Appbox. Let me tell you what's changed.

## Enterprise-Grade Hardware

We've deployed Nokia 7750 SR-1 routers across our infrastructure. If you're not familiar with Nokia's routing gear, these are the same routers that power some of the largest ISPs and data centers in the world. They're built for reliability and performance at scale, and they're now handling all of your traffic.

This isn't consumer or prosumer equipment. This is proper enterprise networking hardware that gives us the control and capabilities we need to deliver the performance you deserve.

## Our Own IP Space

We're now routing traffic through our own IP addresses under our Autonomous System ([AS209870](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&type=aut-num&key=AS209870)). This means we have complete control over how your data travels across the internet.

Why does this matter? Because we can optimize routing specifically for Appbox users, implement better DDoS protection, and in the future, offer features like dedicated IP addresses for those who need them.

## 100G AMS-IX Connectivity

The big one. We're now peering with AMS-IX at 100 gigabits per second. AMS-IX is one of the largest internet exchanges in the world, and having direct access means your traffic takes the fastest possible route to major networks and content providers.

In real terms, this means:
- **Lower latency** - your connections are faster and more responsive
- **Better speeds** - more bandwidth means less congestion
- **Improved reliability** - direct peering means fewer points of failure

We've been testing this over the past few weeks with a subset of traffic, and the results have been exactly what we hoped for. Now everyone gets to benefit.

## Black Friday - 30% Off for 3 Months

To celebrate this milestone (and because it's Black Friday weekend), we're running our biggest promotion ever.

### New Customers

**Get 30% off your first 3 months** on any plan. Just use code **APPBOX30** at checkout. This applies to monthly subscriptions only, so if you want to take advantage of this deal, make sure you select monthly billing.

### Existing Customers - Upgrades

Want to upgrade to a bigger plan? We've got you covered too. **Get 30% off your upgrade** with code **UPGRADE30**. The upgrade fee will be prorated based on your current billing cycle, then reduced by 30%. Your next 2 months after the upgrade will also have 30% off the full price.

#### How to Upgrade

1. Log in to your [billing account](https://billing.appbox.co/clientarea.php)
2. Go to **My Products & Services** and select your Appbox
3. Click the **Upgrade/Downgrade** button in the Actions section
4. Choose your new plan and enter code **UPGRADE30** at checkout

This is genuinely the best deal we've ever offered, and it's our way of saying thanks for being part of the Appbox community.

## VPS Apps - Coming Before Christmas

I know a lot of you have been waiting for this one. VPS apps are still on track and we're aiming to have them ready before Christmas.

For those who missed the earlier announcement, VPS apps give you full root access with no restrictions. You'll be able to run Docker, Snap, Tailscale, and anything else that needs proper system-level access. It's the flexibility of a VPS combined with our one-click app deployment.

We've also got something else in the works that we're not ready to announce yet. Let's just say there's a surprise feature coming with the VPS release that we think you're going to love. More on that soon.

## What's Next

This network upgrade is just the foundation. Now that we have proper control over our infrastructure, we can start building features that weren't possible before:

- **Dedicated IP addresses** - for users who need their own IP
- **Advanced routing options** - more control over how your traffic flows
- **Enhanced DDoS protection** - leveraging our new infrastructure for better security
- **Geographic optimization** - as we expand our peering relationships

We'll keep you updated as these features develop.

## Thank You

Seriously, thank you. Building infrastructure like this takes time, money, and a lot of trust from our users. The fact that you've stuck with us while we've been working on this means everything.

If you notice any issues or have feedback about the new network, please reach out. We're monitoring everything closely, but real-world feedback from actual users is invaluable.

Here's to faster, more reliable hosting. 🚀
