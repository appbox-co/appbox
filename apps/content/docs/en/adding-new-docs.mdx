# For documentation

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `apps/content/docs/[language]` folder with the content of your document.
2. Add the document to the site's navigation menu.
    To do this, add a new item to the `src/config/docs.ts` file in the `sidebarNav` property with the desired information, just follow the pattern of the existing items. By doing this, the document will also be added to the search command palette.

## MDX Document Settings

MDX documents are stored in the `apps/content/docs/[language]` and `apps/content/blog/[language]` folder. Each document is an MDX file that contains a header with metadata, such as title and description. Below is an example of a document header:

```mdx
---
title: Document Title
description: Document Description.
---
```

To add new metadata to the document, you can add new keys to the header. For example, you can add an `author` key to indicate the document author:

```mdx
---
title: Document Title
description: Document Description.
author: Author Name
---
```

But when adding custom metadata, you also need to update the `contentlayer.config.ts` file located at the root of the project and inside the `fields` property in the `Doc` or `Blog` constants.
After that, you will need to display the new information in the document template. To do this, you will need to update the `src/app/[locale]/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` file, or `src/app/[locale]/blog/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` or one of its child components.
