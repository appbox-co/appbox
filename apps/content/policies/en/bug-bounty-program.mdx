title: Bug Bounty Program
description: Our security vulnerability reporting program and rewards
---

At Appbox, security is a fundamental priority. We actively encourage security researchers to help strengthen our platform by identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities. This program outlines our approach to responsible security research, how we handle vulnerability reports, and the rewards we offer to researchers who help improve our security posture.

## Our Commitment

When you participate in our bug bounty program, we promise to:

* Acknowledge and evaluate your report in a timely manner
* Address confirmed vulnerabilities with appropriate urgency
* Recognize and reward you for unique, previously unreported vulnerabilities that lead to security improvements

## Program Coverage

This bug bounty program applies to the following Appbox platforms:

* Appbox Primary Website [https://www.appbox.co]
* Appbox Control Panel [https://www.appbox.co/login]
* Appbox Hosting Infrastructure [username.appboxes.co] - **Infrastructure only, not customer applications**

**Note:** While our hosting infrastructure (username.appboxes.co) is in scope, vulnerabilities in third-party applications deployed by customers are not. See exclusions below.

## What Qualifies as a Valid Vulnerability

To qualify for our bug bounty program, a submission must meet ALL of the following criteria:

### 1. Demonstrate Actual Exploitation
* Include a working proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability can be exploited
* Show clear security impact, theoretical vulnerabilities without demonstrated harm do not qualify
* Prove that an attacker could actually compromise user data, accounts, or system integrity

### 2. Affect In-Scope Systems
* The vulnerability must exist in Appbox's proprietary code or infrastructure
* Must affect systems explicitly listed in "Program Coverage" above
* Must be reproducible on our production or staging environments

### 3. Be Previously Unreported
* The vulnerability must be newly discovered and not already known to us
* Duplicate reports or variations of known issues do not qualify

## Excluded Areas and Issues

The following are considered **outside the scope** of our bug bounty program:

### Third-Party Systems and Integrations
* WHMCS Client Area [https://billing.appbox.co] - Report to [WHMCS Security](https://www.whmcs.com/security-bounty-program/)
* Chatwoot chat widget - Report to [Chatwoot Security](https://www.chatwoot.com/security)
* **Customer-deployed applications** [app.username.appboxes.co] - Vulnerabilities in third-party applications (WordPress, Nextcloud, etc.) hosted on our infrastructure should be reported to the respective application vendors
* Any other third-party services, plugins, or integrations we use
* IP addresses or domains not directly controlled by Appbox
* Legacy or deprecated systems no longer in active use

**Out-of-Scope for Hosting Infrastructure:**
* Vulnerabilities within customer-deployed application code (WordPress, Nextcloud, etc.)
* Default configurations of third-party applications
* Security issues specific to a particular application version

### Security Headers and Hardening
* Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, COOP, COEP, MTA-STS, etc.) **unless** you demonstrate actual exploitation leading to data compromise
* Missing `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` attributes
* Server version disclosure or HTTP header information leakage
* Cookie attributes on non-sensitive cookies (analytics, preferences, etc.)

### Low-Impact Information Disclosure
* Verbose error messages that don't expose sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
* Path disclosure without demonstrated path traversal or file access
* Technology stack identification (PHP version, framework detection, etc.)
* Generic application responses or behavior

### Design Decisions and Theoretical Issues
* Login CSRF (does not provide attacker access to victim accounts)
* User enumeration via timing attacks or differential responses (unless part of a larger attack chain)
* Clickjacking without demonstrated exploitation of sensitive functionality
* CORS configurations on non-sensitive endpoints
* Missing rate limiting **unless** you demonstrate actual abuse (DoS is still excluded)

### Attack Prerequisites
* Security issues that don't affect our default application configurations
* Vulnerabilities requiring non-standard configurations
* Vulnerabilities in our containers that require custom or modified setups
* Issues requiring network-level compromise (MITM, DNS poisoning, ARP spoofing)

### Prohibited Testing Methods
* Timing-based information disclosure attacks
* Process enumeration techniques
* Any form of denial of service or high-volume attacks
* Social engineering and phishing techniques
* Automated security scanning that generates excessive traffic or loads
* Testing non-functional features or pages (e.g., signup pages not yet in production)

### Invalid Report Types
* Reports based solely on automated scanner output without manual validation
* Generic recommendations without demonstrating actual vulnerabilities
* Best practice suggestions without security impact
* Compliance observations (PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.) without demonstrating exploitability

Contributors who report valid vulnerabilities will be recognized in our Security Researchers Hall of Fame as a token of our appreciation.

## Required Report Quality

All vulnerability reports must include:

* **Clear vulnerability description** - Explain what the vulnerability is and why it matters
* **Affected system/URL** - Specify exactly where the vulnerability exists
* **Step-by-step reproduction** - Detailed steps that allow us to reproduce the issue
* **Working proof of concept** - Functional demonstration of exploitation (code, screenshots, video)
* **Actual security impact** - Demonstrate what an attacker could accomplish, not theoretical possibilities
* **Your own testing** - Validate findings manually, don't just forward scanner output

Reports that lack these elements or consist of generic security recommendations will not qualify for rewards.

## Claiming Your Reward

* You may choose between two reward options:  
   * Direct PayPal payment (requires a valid PayPal account)
   * Appbox service credits (applicable to any Appbox service, non-transferable)

## Participation Guidelines

* Adhere to this policy, our [Terms of Service](/policies/terms-of-service), and all applicable laws
* Report vulnerabilities promptly after discovery
* Respect user privacy and system integrity during your research
* Submit all vulnerability reports exclusively through our [contact us form](https://billing.appbox.co/contact.php)
* Maintain confidentiality about discovered vulnerabilities until resolved
* Limit your testing to systems explicitly included in this program
* If you gain unexpected access to sensitive data: access only the minimum amount needed to demonstrate the issue, stop testing immediately, and report the vulnerability promptly
* Use only your own test accounts for any interaction with our systems
* Never attempt to extort Appbox based on your findings
* **Verify your findings** - Test that your proof of concept actually works before submitting
* **Focus on impact** - Prioritize vulnerabilities that could cause real harm over theoretical issues

## Legal Protection

Security researchers following this policy can expect:

* Protection from legal action for good-faith security research conducted within these guidelines
* Exemption from anti-circumvention legal claims when necessary for legitimate security research
* Waiver of certain policy restrictions that would otherwise prevent security testing
* Recognition that compliant security research is beneficial and conducted in good faith

You remain responsible for complying with all applicable laws. If you face legal action from a third party while adhering to this policy, we will affirm that your actions were conducted in compliance with our program. If you're uncertain about whether your planned research activities comply with this policy, please contact us through the [contact us form](https://billing.appbox.co/contact.php) before proceeding.

## Reporting Process

To report a vulnerability, create a detailed ticket through our [contact us form](https://billing.appbox.co/contact.php).

* Your report should include comprehensive steps to reproduce the vulnerability. You may use this template as a guide: [https://github.com/ZephrFish/BugBountyTemplates/blob/master/Example.md](https://github.com/ZephrFish/BugBountyTemplates/blob/master/Example.md)
* All program communications must go through our official Support Ticket Platform
* Public disclosure of any vulnerability without explicit written permission from Appbox violates this program's terms and will disqualify you from receiving a reward

## What Happens After You Report

* **Valid vulnerabilities**: We will acknowledge your report, work on a fix, and process your reward
* **Invalid reports**: We will explain why the report doesn't qualify and may provide guidance for future submissions
* **Out-of-scope reports**: We will redirect you to the appropriate vendor or explain why the issue isn't covered

We appreciate quality research and constructive contributions to our security. Thank you for helping keep Appbox secure.
