title: Bug Bounty Program
description: Our security vulnerability reporting program and rewards
---

At Appbox, security is a fundamental priority. We actively encourage security researchers to help strengthen our platform by identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities. This program outlines our approach to responsible security research, how we handle vulnerability reports, and the rewards we offer to researchers who help improve our security posture.

## Our Commitment

When you participate in our bug bounty program, we promise to:

* Acknowledge and evaluate your report in a timely manner
* Address confirmed vulnerabilities with appropriate urgency
* Recognize and reward you for unique, previously unreported vulnerabilities that lead to security improvements

## Program Coverage

This bug bounty program applies to the following Appbox platforms:

* Appbox Primary Website [https://www.appbox.co]
* Appbox Control Panel [https://www.appbox.co/login]
* Appbox Hosting Infrastructure [username.appboxes.co]

## Excluded Areas and Issues

The following are considered outside the scope of our bug bounty program:

* WHMCS Client Area [https://billing.appbox.co] - Vulnerabilities should be reported directly to WHMCS through their own security program
* Security issues that don't affect our default application configurations
* Vulnerabilities in our containers that require non-standard configurations
* Timing-based information disclosure attacks
* Process enumeration techniques
* Any form of denial of service or high-volume attacks
* Social engineering and phishing techniques
* Automated security scanning that generates excessive traffic or loads

## Reporting Process

To report a vulnerability, create a detailed ticket through our [contact us form](https://billing.appbox.co/contact.php).

* Your report should include comprehensive steps to reproduce the vulnerability. You may use this template as a guide: [https://github.com/ZephrFish/BugBountyTemplates/blob/master/Example.md](https://github.com/ZephrFish/BugBountyTemplates/blob/master/Example.md)
* All program communications must go through our official Support Ticket Platform
* Public disclosure of any vulnerability without explicit written permission from Appbox violates this program's terms and will disqualify you from receiving a reward
