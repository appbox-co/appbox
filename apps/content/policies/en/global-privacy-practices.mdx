## UK Online Safety Act Compliance

As a UK service provider, we comply with the Online Safety Act 2023 which aims to protect users, particularly children, from harmful and illegal content online. In accordance with this legislation:

1. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**: We conduct regular risk assessments regarding illegal content and content harmful to children, implementing proportionate systems to minimize these risks.

2. **Special Protections**: We maintain enhanced precautions to protect children and vulnerable users from harmful content.

3. **Balancing Rights**: Our compliance with the Online Safety Act is implemented in a way that respects users' freedom of expression and privacy rights.

4. **Regulatory Cooperation**: We maintain appropriate procedures to cooperate with Ofcom (the UK's communications regulator) in their regulatory duties, including providing information when legally required.

5. **Transparency**: We publish annual transparency reports regarding our content moderation practices and safety systems as required by the Act.

## Notice

* We let you know when we're collecting your personal information.
* In our Data Handling Policy, we let you know what purposes we have to collect and use your information, whom we share that information with and under what restrictions, and what access you have to your data.

## Choice

* We let you choose what happens to your data. Before we use your data for a purpose other than the one for which you gave it to us, we will let you know and get your permission.
* We will provide you with reasonable mechanisms to make your choices.

## Accountability for Onward Transfer

* If needed, we share only the amount of data with our third-party vendors as is necessary to complete their transaction.
* For payments, all information is handled by our payment processors.
* Under no circumstances do we sell your data to third parties, nor our payment processors share their information with us other than verification of payments.

## Security

* We will protect your personal information with all reasonable and appropriate security measures.

## Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

* We only collect your data for the purposes relevant to providing our services to you.
* We collect as little information about you as we can unless you choose to give us more.

## Access

* You are always able to access the data we have about you in your Appbox user profile. You may access, update, alter, or delete your information there.

## Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability

* If you have questions about our privacy practices, you can reach us with our ticketing system, and we will respond as soon as possible.
* We will conduct regular audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify compliance with our promises.
* We require our employees to respect our privacy promises, and violation of our privacy policies is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

## Data Breach Notification Process

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information, Appbox will:

1. Notify the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, where feasible
2. Promptly inform affected users about the breach when it is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms
3. Provide clear information about the nature of the breach, likely consequences, and measures taken to address and mitigate potential adverse effects
4. Document all breaches, including facts, effects, and remedial actions taken

This process complies with UK GDPR requirements and demonstrates our commitment to protecting your data and responding transparently to security incidents.

## Legal Basis for Processing

Under UK data protection law, we must have a valid legal basis for processing your personal information. Depending on the context, we rely on the following legal bases:

1. **Contract Performance**: Processing necessary to deliver our services to you under our Terms of Service agreement
2. **Legal Obligation**: Processing required to comply with our legal obligations under UK law
3. **Legitimate Interests**: Processing that serves our legitimate business interests, such as improving our services, preventing fraud, and ensuring network security
4. **Consent**: In specific situations where we seek your explicit permission

We do not rely on consent as a legal basis when the law allows us to process your data on another legal ground.

## International Data Transfers

As a UK-based hosting company, we may transfer your personal data to countries outside the UK for processing. When we do so, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information:

1. We prioritize transfers to countries with adequate data protection standards as determined by UK authorities
2. Where necessary, we implement appropriate transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
3. We conduct data protection impact assessments for high-risk transfers
4. Our agreements with third-party processors include specific data protection obligations

These measures ensure that your data receives equivalent protection when processed internationally as it would in the UK.
