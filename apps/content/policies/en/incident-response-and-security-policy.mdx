title: Incident Response and Security Policy
description: How we handle security incidents and maintain platform security
---

Despite our best efforts and rigorous audits, security incidents are an inevitable part of any online business. Your security is important to us, and we are fully committed to both your security and that of our platform. We maintain a culture of transparency and honesty, which extends to our approach for reporting security incidents. In the event of a security incident, Appbox will take the following actions:

1. If necessary, we will restrict connections to affected Appbox servers to resolve the incident quickly
2. As soon as any incidents are reported or discovered, we will publish details on our communication channels including:
   - Our website
   - Our [status page](https://status.appbox.co)
   - Email notifications to affected clients

We will also start emailing affected clients directly, though it may take some time for all communications to be dispatched.

If you're experiencing issues with your services, please check our [status page](https://status.appbox.co). It's most likely you will see maintenance work related to your service. If there is no ongoing maintenance, feel free to [open a support ticket](https://billing.appbox.co/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3) so we can investigate your issues and guide you accordingly.

## Security-First Infrastructure

* We carefully assess third-party partners and vendors for both suitability and security risk. We ensure the right technical and contractual commitments are in place for all partnerships.
* We use enterprise-grade, high-availability data centers with your availability and security in mind—all with rigorous physical security measures.
* We implement private VLANs within our network infrastructure to isolate customer data, enhance security, and prevent potential network-level intrusions. Our in-house networking team manages these VLANs to ensure optimal security.
