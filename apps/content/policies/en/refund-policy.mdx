## 7-Day Refund Policy

For new customers, Appbox offers a 7-day refund window. If you're not completely satisfied with our service within the first 7 days, you can request a pro-rated refund by opening a [support ticket](https://billing.appbox.co/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3).

The pro-rated refund is calculated based on the number of days the service has been used. For instance, if you use a Beginner plan for 3 days and then request a refund, you'll receive a refund for 4 days' worth of service.

## Refund Eligibility

### New Customers

As mentioned above, new customers are eligible for a refund if requested within 7 days of the initial purchase of any of our plans (Beginner, Appbox, or Dedicated).

### Existing Customers

For existing customers, the following guidelines apply:

1. **Service Upgrades**: If you upgrade your service and are not satisfied, you may request to be downgraded, but no refund will be provided for the difference.
2. **Additional Services**: No refunds are available for additional services (e.g., dedicated IP addresses).
3. **Service Renewals**: No refunds are available for service renewals after the 7-day period has elapsed from the initial purchase.

### Refund Limitation

To prevent abuse of our refund system, customers are limited to **one refund per 6-month period**. This means that if you have already received a refund within the past 6 months, you will not be eligible for another refund until 6 months have passed from the date of your previous refund.

## Non-Refundable Terms

The following terms are not eligible for refunds under any circumstances:

1. Payments using cryptocurrencies
2. The purchase of dedicated IP addresses
3. Overpayments exceeding 3 months of service
