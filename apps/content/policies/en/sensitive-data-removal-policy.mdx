## Understanding Sensitive Information

At Appbox, we define sensitive information as:

1. Personal contact details
2. Identification numbers and documents
3. Financial information
4. Authentication credentials
5. Any other information that could pose a risk if exposed

## Your Right to Data Deletion

In accordance with the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to request deletion of your personal data (the "right to be forgotten"). When you make such a request:

1. We will delete your account and associated personal information
2. We will remove your data from our active systems
3. Your data will no longer be accessible to Appbox staff or other users

## Data Retention for Legal Compliance

While we can delete your account and personal information, we are legally required to retain certain transaction records to comply with UK tax regulations and HMRC requirements:

1. Transaction records including dates, amounts, and basic identification information
2. Invoice details and payment confirmations
3. Any information necessary for tax reporting and financial audits

This retained information is:
- Kept only as long as legally required
- Secured with appropriate safeguards
- Accessible only to personnel who need it for compliance purposes
- Not used for marketing or other commercial purposes

## Username Modifications

While we understand that circumstances may require you to change your username, our technical architecture presents certain limitations. Due to how our system is designed, we cannot simply rename an existing Appbox. Instead, our process involves:

1. Creating a new Appbox with your requested username
2. Providing you with options to transfer your data:
   - Self-migration of your content to the new Appbox
   - Support-assisted migration (upon request)
3. Permanently deleting your previous Appbox after successful data transfer

We require a valid justification for username changes to prevent abuse of this service.

## Email Address Updates

Keeping your contact information current is important. To update the email address associated with your account:

1. Submit a support ticket using our [Billing & Account Questions](https://billing.appbox.co/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2) department specifying your desired new email address
2. After verification, we'll update your account records
3. You'll then use this new email address for all future logins and communications

We strongly recommend maintaining an up-to-date email address, as we use this channel for critical service notifications, maintenance alerts, and account communications.

## Making a Data Removal Request

To initiate any sensitive data removal process:

1. Log in to your [Appbox Client Area](https://billing.appbox.co)
2. Create a detailed ticket through our [Support Ticket System](https://billing.appbox.co/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=3)
3. Clearly state the nature of your request and provide any necessary information
4. Our team will review your request and respond with appropriate next steps

We prioritize our users' privacy and will handle all such requests promptly and with discretion.
