title: Service Level Agreement
description: Our dedication to service consistency and dependability

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a document governing the Terms and usage of the Services furnished by Appbox. By utilizing our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the terms laid out below.

Because we operate in a shared environment and provide services of a particular nature, some level of downtime may sometimes be unavoidable. This agreement clarifies how we manage downtime occurrences throughout your subscription period and describes our commitments to resolving disputes and offering compensation.

## Server Downtimes, Server Maintenance & Compensation

Appbox makes every effort to keep our servers operational and accessible for all users throughout their billing term.

When server maintenance is arranged ahead of time, users will be notified through multiple channelsâ€”such as email updates, the Appbox Status Page, and Client Area Announcements. Any user affected by planned maintenance is not eligible for compensation.

Unscheduled or emergency maintenance procedures will be communicated as promptly as possible, and users affected by such events may qualify for credits as specified below:

| Duration of Downtime  | Compensation                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up to 6 hours         | Determined at team's discretion                                                                                                            |
| Up to 12 hours        | Equivalent to 1 day of service credit                                                                                                       |
| Up to 24 hours        | Equivalent to 2 days of service credit                                                                                                      |
| Beyond 48 hours       | Credited at twice the length of the downtime (for instance, a 3-day outage yields 6 days of service credit)                                 |

This policy **excludes any downtime associated with the applications you have installed.**

## Drive Failure and Data Loss

Appbox's platform is based on a shared infrastructure designed to offer fair resource distribution and comprehensive disk usage. Despite our best efforts, hardware failures, such as drive malfunctions, can sometimes arise.

If a drive failure causes you to lose access to your data and it cannot be recovered, you will qualify for **one full month of service at no cost**.

We highly advise keeping backups of all essential data that you store on your service.

Please note that if data is lost due to user-initiated actions (e.g., accidental deletion) and no system-related error is detected, no compensation will be provided.

## Fair Use of Server Resources

Our Services are delivered on shared resources, so it is crucial for each client to ensure that their activities do not disrupt other users' performance and remain within acceptable resource limits.

Appbox may, without prior notice, halt any applications or processes that negatively impact other clients' experiences. In severe cases of resource misuse, the client's service could be suspended or terminated entirely.

### Disk I/O Fair Use Policy

This policy applies only to plans NG-8000 and smaller (non-dedicated disk plans).

To ensure optimal performance for all users, Appbox employs an automated Disk I/O monitoring system that:

1. Continuously monitors disk utilization across all shared resources
2. Identifies applications consuming excessive disk I/O resources for extended periods of time
3. Automatically applies throttling measures when necessary

If your application is detected as consuming excessive disk I/O:
- You may receive a warning notification
- Persistent high usage will result in automatic throttling of your disk I/O speed
- Repeated violations will lead to increasingly strict throttling limits
- Throttling is temporary and will be automatically removed once usage returns to normal levels

Please note that resource-intensive applications may trigger these measures if run without consideration for other users.

We enforce this policy to guarantee that all users have a satisfying experience on our platform.

## Support Response Times

We have no minimum support response or resolve time, however we aim to answer all support queries within 24 hours.
