title: Terms of Service
description: Terms and conditions for using our service
---

You are only permitted to make use of our Services if you accept these Terms. By ordering or paying for any Services, you confirm your acceptance of these Terms in an agreement between you and Appbox. These Terms remain valid and applicable, independent of any other contract or arrangement you may have with Appbox. Unless a written agreement with Appbox states otherwise, all supplementary arrangements remain subject to the fundamental conditions described here. If any separate agreement with Appbox contradicts these Terms, that separate agreement will prevail. You must also be of legal age to establish a binding contract and must not be disqualified from using Services under the laws of your jurisdiction. The latest version of these Terms can be found at https://www.appbox.co/policies/terms-of-service.

## General Terms of Service

1. The client is responsible for all content and activities in any Appbox plan. Any action taken within the client's userspace—whether authorized or not—will be considered the client's responsibility. All users must adhere to these Terms of Service (hereafter referred to as the "TOS").
2. Users are accountable for keeping their services secure in accordance with our [Password Policy](/policies/password-policy). Appbox bears no responsibility if a user account is compromised due to inadequate passwords or sharing login credentials with friends, family, or any third party.
3. The following tools and programs are not permitted on any Appbox plan:  
   - Tor relays/exit nodes  
   - Hacking utilities  
   - Spam-related software  
   - Phishing tools  
   - Fraudulent gateways  
   - Any malicious content that could damage Appbox's reputation  
   - Cryptocurrency or other forms of mining  
   - Peer-to-peer load balancers  
   - Game servers (unless installed through our App Store)
4. All user resources must require valid authentication, including applications. The operation of open or publicly accessible directories is prohibited.
5. The client is responsible for ensuring all invoices are paid on time. Unpaid invoices will lead to suspension of service, and if left unresolved, the service may be terminated and all stored data deleted. Any overpayment caused by incorrect recurring payments is non-refundable; instead, it will be applied as a credit on the client's account for use on future charges.
6. We ask that you remain courteous to our staff. In return, our team will treat you with the same level of respect. Any client who is excessively rude risks having their account banned from Appbox.
7. The resale of any Appbox services, or portions of them, is strictly prohibited. Any user found engaging in such resale activities will face immediate account termination without any refund. This includes, but is not limited to, providing paid access to streaming platforms, hosting IPTV services, or distributing content in exchange for payment.
8. Clients are responsible for preserving and protecting any data stored on their Appbox account. Our services do not have built-in redundancy and data loss is possible. We recommend keeping important files backed up through dedicated cloud hosting providers.
9. Appbox reserves the right to change prices, storage size, network speed, network capacity, and computing resources of all services at any time, at its own discretion.
10. Users are solely responsible for any data transferred through the Appbox platform. Downloading, uploading, and sharing copyright-protected files of any type is explicitly disallowed.
11. We may update the TOS at any time. Continued usage of our Services demonstrates your acceptance of any modifications.

### Content Reporting and Moderation

Users must report any illegal or harmful content encountered on our platform through our designated reporting channels as specified in our [Content Abuse Policy](/policies/content-abuse-policy). We take these reports seriously and will act promptly to investigate and address legitimate concerns.

When we receive reports of potentially illegal or harmful content:

1. We will assess the content against our policies and applicable laws
2. We may temporarily restrict access to the reported content during investigation
3. If the content violates our policies or the law, we will remove it and take appropriate action against the account
4. We will notify relevant parties of our decision and actions taken
5. Where required by law, we will report serious illegal content to appropriate authorities

### Compliance Measures

To ensure compliance with the Online Safety Act, Appbox has implemented the following measures:

1. **Risk Assessment**: We conduct regular risk assessments regarding illegal content and content harmful to children, implementing proportionate measures to mitigate identified risks.

2. **Content Moderation**: Appbox employs both automated systems and human review to moderate content in compliance with the OSA. We reserve the right to remove content, suspend services, or terminate accounts found to be in violation of this policy.

3. **Reporting Mechanisms**: We provide clear mechanisms for reporting illegal or harmful content as outlined in our [Content Abuse Policy](/policies/content-abuse-policy). All users are required to promptly report any illegal or harmful content discovered on our platform.

4. **Cooperation with Authorities**: We will cooperate with UK regulatory authorities, including Ofcom, in addressing illegal content. This includes providing information as required by law and complying with enforcement notices.

5. **Age Verification**: When applicable, users must ensure appropriate age verification mechanisms are in place for any services they host that could potentially be accessed by children.

By using our Services, you acknowledge these prohibitions and requirements and agree to comply with the Online Safety Act 2023 and all other applicable UK laws.

## Account and Service Responsibilities

The client must keep all data on their service backed up and protected. We strongly advise saving important information to an external cloud solution since we specialize in application hosting, not data storage. Our systems can fail, and we cannot guarantee data retrieval in the event of hardware or other failures. Appbox is not responsible for lost data and will not be held accountable, financially or otherwise, if recovery is not possible.

We recommend setting unique and strong passwords for the Appbox Client Area, Control Panel, SSH, and other applications. Users should follow our [Password Policy](/policies/password-policy). For maximum account security, we strongly encourage enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your [account security page](https://billing.appbox.co/user/security). Any use of our services that violates these Terms will be deemed a TOS violation, whether or not an account has been compromised.

## Sharing and Reselling

It is forbidden to allow the general public to access our services. This includes offering public HTTP directories, hosting video streams, or creating publicly accessible services. If we find that a client has made any services public, we will ask them to restrict access; continued non-compliance will result in account termination.

Appbox's services are meant for personal use. We allow minor sharing of installed applications or data with family and close friends. Although we respect your privacy, Appbox may monitor the number of unique users accessing a given application or service to ensure no unauthorized resale or misuse. We do not track which specific individuals are using your services, only the count of unique connections.

Reselling any function of our services is strictly prohibited. Any individual discovered receiving payment or other compensation in exchange for access to our services will have their account terminated immediately and will not receive a refund.

## Fair Usage

Because our Services rely on shared resources, clients are responsible for making sure their usage doesn't negatively impact others. All users must keep their resource consumption within appropriate limits. Appbox reserves the right to halt any applications that disrupt other clients' activities and can reallocate resources if it deems them misused, without prior notice. In extreme cases of abuse, a client's service may be suspended or terminated. Our primary objective is to ensure everyone can enjoy a positive experience.

Appbox will not be responsible for any harm or losses you might face as a result, and we do not issue refunds for client fees when services are interrupted under these circumstances. Users agree not to disturb other customers' usage in any unfair or malicious way that would deprive them of the service level they expect.

## Payments

We send invoices 10 days before their due date, plus a reminder three days before. If the invoice remains unpaid on the due date, the service will be suspended. Additional reminders are sent on day 1, day 4, and day 9 past the due date. If the payment remains outstanding by the 10th day at 00:00 UTC, the service is terminated, and all data is removed permanently. Any payment made after this time results in a completely new service and does not qualify for a refund under our policy.

## Refunds

We have a specific [Refund Policy](/policies/refund-policy) that serves as a trial period for new users. Please refer to our [Refund Policy](/policies/refund-policy) for details.

## Chargebacks and Disputes

In case of chargebacks and unfair disputes, Appbox reserves the right to provide relevant information, as permitted in our [Data Handling Policy](/policies/data-handling-policy), to our payment processors. By using our Services, you agree to resolve any issues directly with us first. Initiating a chargeback or dispute with any payment processor to forcibly remove funds from us is considered a violation of these Terms.

## Cancellations

You can cancel your service at any time by submitting a [cancellation request](https://billing.appbox.co/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=4) via our support ticket system.

## Privacy

The customer acknowledges and agrees to the Appbox [Privacy Policy](/policies/global-privacy-practices).

## Failure to Pay

In the event of nonpayment, Appbox retains the option to delete or keep any content stored on our servers.

## Software & Service Updates

We may update or modify software that comes with the Services at any time. These updates often address quality improvements and bug fixes. By using our Services, you accept such updates.

## Common Carrier

Appbox and the customer agree that, as a service provider, Appbox operates as a common carrier. The customer is deemed the publisher of any data or materials it distributes, making it their responsibility to comply with these Terms. While Appbox does not proactively monitor or censor the data shared by our customers, we maintain compliance with the UK Online Safety Act 2023 and other applicable laws regarding illegal and harmful content. As required by these laws, we implement appropriate systems for reporting, removing, and preventing the redistribution of such content. Appbox's role in distributing customer-supplied material does not signify endorsement or any assurance of compliance with the Terms.

## Notices

Any notices pertaining to these Terms can be sent via email, delivered in person, or directed to any location or method specified in writing by the parties involved.

## Limitation of Liability

Appbox does not guarantee the security or confidentiality of content transmitted over the Internet or through other external network or service providers. While we implement systems to comply with the Online Safety Act and other applicable laws, we cannot guarantee that all illegal or harmful content will be detected or prevented.

## Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Appbox harmless against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and costs) arising out of third-party allegations (including those from the customer's own users) related to any actions you take or content you distribute. This includes indemnification for any penalties or fines imposed on Appbox by regulatory authorities as a result of your violation of the Online Safety Act or other applicable laws.

## DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

**ALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY APPBOX ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. APPBOX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPBOX BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF APPBOX HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF SERVICE IS INTERRUPTED OR MALFUNCTIONS FOR ANY REASON, APPBOX WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF INCOME RESULTING FROM THE OUTAGE OR MALFUNCTION.**
